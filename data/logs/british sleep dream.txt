    I get out of school and go to a store with some classmates to get snacks.
    They tell me to hurry while i cant decide what to get.
    They are telling me that something bad is gonna happen if i dont hurry now so i just grab a bag of chips and get out.
    At home my brother is sleeping and he tells me that at 2pm on a sunday british people sleep.
    Thats why i had to hurry out of the store.
    Than i wake up!
    Wanna know what else is crazy?
    I woke up at exactly 2 pm.
