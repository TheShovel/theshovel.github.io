Lately nothing has been feeling real. All of the things i wanted to do and the dreams i had of the amazing stuff i wanted to achieve are gone. Every time i try to go back to it, something pulls me back.

Im not healthy, im not sleeping well and im not happy.
It feels like the entire world is against me all the time. It feels like everyone is trying to stop me. I dont know why or who could be doing it, but thats how i feel.

I sometimes lie to people online so i stop being bothered by them. The pressure of people is not something i like. I tried taking my life again, but i didnt. I dont know why.

I am disappointing people that believe in me and feedin the ones that want the worst for me.
