    A dream that I had repeating multiple nights about me going into a big city, being in an area where I vaguely remember the location but not much then searching for a bus stop, but searching a lot for it and stuff while it turns out to be really obvious where it was.
    Also for some reason in those dreams I kept going to subway to get a sandwich.
