I dont really remember what i dreamt about last night. It was a very comforting dream though. I slept pretty well.
Its all very fuzzy but i think i was with someone else and they were making me feel very happy.
I noticed that i dont remember dreams well when something wakes
me up all of a sudden. If i just wake up
naturally i remember my dreams very well. Today my dad woke me up to ask me if i want to go somewhere. I said no because i went to bed verly late and i was sleepy. Then i went back to bed for a few hours and completely forgot the dream i had before. This was the first dream that was not a nightmare in a while. I wish i had more of these, but to be honest, my nightmares are more interesting to write
about.
