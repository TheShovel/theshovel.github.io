    I dont really remember what I dreamt about last night. It was a very comforting dream though. I slept pretty well.
    Its all very fuzzy but I think I was with someone else and they were making me feel very happy.
    I noticed that I dont remember dreams well when something wakes me up all of a sudden.
    If I just wake up naturally I remember my dreams very well.
    Today my dad woke me up to ask me if I want to go somewhere. I said no because I went to bed verly late and I was sleepy. Then I went back to bed for a few hours and completely forgot the dream I had before.
    This was the first dream that was not a nightmare in a while. I wish I had more of these, but to be honest, my nightmares are more interesting to write about.
