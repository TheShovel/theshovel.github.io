    If there is an afterlife, do you think that people there place bets on stuff happening?
    "Dude, I bet 50 ghost bucks that in the next 2 years that guy is gonna get in a car crash."
    Or "Im gonna bet 2000 dabloons that in 20 years humanity will end itself."
    Now that I'm thinking about it, if there are ghost currencies then there must be ghost jobs.
    What jobs do you think ghosts would have?
