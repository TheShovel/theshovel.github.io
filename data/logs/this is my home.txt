I've been feeling like I don't belong in the world I live in lately.
I am doing all this amazing stuff. People are praising me for it, they are telling me that I am inspiring them and that I'm cool and all that.

This only happens while I'm in front of a screen. As soon as I look away, theres nothing for me. No one truly likes me for who I am. No one is praising my work.

There's just nothing for me out there. The internet is my world. My home. My friends and people are here. Not out there.
I know that these people are also out there in the real world, and that you could say "oh just meet up with these people!", but think about that for more than 5 seconds. It's not that easy...

With that said though, I still hope it happens one day. That I get to meet everyone online in the real world, and that I can name that place my home instead.
