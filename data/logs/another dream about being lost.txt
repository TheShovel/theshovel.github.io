    I had another one of those bus dreams. I am in a big city with a friend again, then we go towards the bus station to get the bus home.
    While walking there and talking with my friend, all of a sudden he disappears and I get lost. I dont know where the bus stop is and there is no one to ask for directions.
    I pick up my phone to look at my messages and I see my friend posting images of a game he is playing.
    For some reason I dont think about searching where the bus stop is on google maps or something. Anyway, after that something else happens but its really fuzzy, and I dont remember.
