I had another one of those bus dreams. I am in a big city with a friend again, then we go towards the bus station to get the bus home. While walking there and talking with my friend, all of a sudden he disappears and i get lost. I dont know where the bus stop is and there is no one to ask for directions.
I pick up my phone to look at my messages and i see my friend posting images of a game he is playing. For some reason i dont think about searching where the bus stop is on google maps or something. Anyway, after that something else happens but its really fuzzy, and i dont remember
