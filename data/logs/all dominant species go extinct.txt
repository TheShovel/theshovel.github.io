    You know what I just realized? That all dominant species go extinct eventually.
    Dinosaurs? BOOOM!!!!
    When the earth froze? EVERYTHING GONEEE!!!!
    Do you think this is intentional behaviour from nature? Like a failsafe so that one species doesnt go too far or something.
    I wonder what will happen to humans this time. People are speculating that because of global warming that thing where everything froze because of exteremes will happen.
    Some think that the sun will just explode when we wont even think about it.
