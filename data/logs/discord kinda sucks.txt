    Ive been thinking about it and Discord (the chatting app) is a terrible place to socialize with people!!
    Most of the people there are teenagers that have too much time on the interent, predators and generally just people you wouldnt want to be around.
    Its very rare that I find people that are nice to talk to and are not trying to be passive agressive or something.
    And usually those people are not even online that often because they have better stuff to do. They have lives and hobbies and they want to do stuff.
    Im considering disabling my Discord account not gonna lie...
