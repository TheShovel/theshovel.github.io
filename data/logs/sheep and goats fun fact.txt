    Did you know that domesticated sheep grow their wool so much that they cant move anymore?
    I learnt about this recently. Apparently its because people started selective breeding sheep to grow wool faster.
    Goats also grow their horns until they go through their skull, which is kinda disturbing not gonna lie.
    I wonder what caused that to happen. Do people use goat horns for imporant stuff besides like decorating?
    Anyway, for wild goats and sheep this doesnt happen, so its all because of humans playing with nature.
