    So im in a very populated city and there is this structure that looks like the eiffel tower. 
    Some guy straps a thing that can lift people up on it from the bottom to the very top with like an elastic cord thing.
    That guy asks his dad to go on it without telling him what it is.
    He lifts his dad all the way up with that thing and at the top there are 4 encapsulated areas that are stuck in time.
    He goes between them and they are different areas. The guy goes in one of them that looks like a mall and there is this huge party or whatever like a concert.
    When his dad steps in he just falls through the floor and falls from the eiffel tower.
    Then I wake up.
    There were more things that happened before this but I cant remember.
