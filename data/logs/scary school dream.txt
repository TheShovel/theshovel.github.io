i went to school after summer vacation but apparently i was late by 1 week
i start crying and call my dad to get me home i go to where my dad parks
the car is open but my dad is not inside and tells me he will come in a bit
i go inside and the car starts going backwards my dad tells me through text to pull the breaks for some reason it doesnt work
so i keep going in directions, i end up in another city
then somehow i come back to the same spot i was un before and i can finally stop the car then i wake up
