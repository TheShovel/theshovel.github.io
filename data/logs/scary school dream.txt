    I went to school after summer vacation but apparently I was late by 1 week.
    I start crying and call my dad to get me home I go to where my dad parks the car is open but my dad is not inside and tells me he will come in a bit.
    I go inside and the car starts going backwards my dad tells me through text to pull the breaks for some reason it doesnt work.
    So I keep going in directions, I end up in another city then somehow I come back to the same spot I was un before and I can finally stop the car then I wake up.
