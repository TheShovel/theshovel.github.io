    i believe that if we knew that we would also know what drives us as humans to do stuff
    why do we want to build more and expand and make new technology
    is it just in our genetics?
    is this what humans do
    i think it would make sense
    we dont really know the purpose of the stuff we do
    and we have been doing this since we know we exist as a species
    its our trait that separates us from other species
    like how fish can stay underwater and bees make polen
    we make technology thats our thing
    even if that means entertainment, making food or whatever else
    i think that many people might not agree with this because they dont like being compared with "inferior" beings
    but are we really that inferior?
    we have tons of weaknesses
    compared to other species even similar to us
    we lack strength and senses to survive
    if you think about it
    everything that is alive
    is only alive to do stuff to help future generations
    even atoms do that
    we are just on another layer of what life means to us
    we probably are atoms to something else
    and those things are atoms that form something else
    and we all just do stuff to improve things for future generations
    we are just part of some other stuff in the world and other stuff is part of us
    and we do stuff to push the ones with a layer above and bellow us
    does that make sense?
